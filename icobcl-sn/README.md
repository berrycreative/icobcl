# IcoBCL SN

The IcoBCL SN WebFont is a free-to-use set that includes icons in solid style, packaged as webfont for easy use.

You can add IcoBCL to your project by downloading the assets directly from Github or by CDN. Source SVG files are also available.

The icons are licenced using Creative Commons BY-SA-4.0 and fonts by MIT licence, allowing for use in commercial projects.


## Getting Started

How does it work? 

1. Start by downloading the package.
2. Add the ```fonts folder``` and ```icobcl-sn.css``` file in your project root.
3. Include the font stylesheet in the ```head``` of your page:

    ```<link rel="stylesheet" href="icobcl-sn.css">```

4. Add the markup ```<span class="ico iconname"></span>```.


### CDN 
You can also use the icons by simply including the CDN link in the ```head``` of your page:

```html 
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/berrycreative/icobcl@main/icobcl-sn/icobcl-sn.css"> 
```


## Using Icons

Display the icons by using classes on the ```<span>``` html tag. For example, you can use the ```nostr icon``` by using the following markup:

```<span class="ico nostr"></span>```

## Why <span>

This way you can use **ICO BCL** Icon Library along with other icon libraries such FontAwesome.
